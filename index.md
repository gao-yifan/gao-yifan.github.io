- <img src="Files/jiufen.jpg" alt="selfie" style="float:right;zoom:14%;margin:100px 300px;"/>I am an Assistant Professor at the [Institute for Theoretical Sciences, Westlake University](https://its.westlake.edu.cn/index.htm). 
- My research lies at the intersection of probability theory and mathematical physics, with a focus on statistical physics and random geometry, including Gaussian free field, Brownian loop soup, percolation, and Schramm-Loewner evolution.
